> NOTE: As of 29 Mar 2019, **SharpDX is no longer being under development or maintenance**
>
> SharpDX has been around for almost 9 years, the project is relatively stable and has been used by many products.
>
> But due to the lack of strong technical leadership and community involvment on the project, SharpDX can no longer maintain the quality required for its maintenance
> In consequence, SharpDX is being retired. You can still download all NuGet binaries, you can fork and modify the project as long as you respect the original License.

> This repository is now readonly
